- In total 90,398 employees will be retiring. That is a large portion of their workforce.

- Surprisingly only two Managers will be retiring soon which could point to other staffing issues unrelated to this analysis.

- There are 1,549 employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program.
- 221 Senior Engineers, 521 Senior Staffs and 455 Engineers make up the majority of eligbible mentors.

## Summary:
- 90,398 positions will need to be filled soon based on the analysis of employees nearing retirement.
- There are 1.549 employees who are eligible to mentor in Pewlett-Hackard currently. This is not enough mentor's to train replacements for that many positions. Clearly lacking mentor's. Based on the previous tables, there is a lack of mentor's throughout all the departments.
- The company needs to re-evaluate their criteria for the Mentorship Program and hopefully be better prepared for the wave of 90.398 employees leaving.
